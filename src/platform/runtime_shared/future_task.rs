//! Local future task plumbing: `FutureTask`, `JoinState`, and the `Send + Sync`
//! waker used to schedule `spawn` continuations.
//!
//! # Why the waker is `Arc`-based
//!
//! `std::task::Waker` is `Send + Sync`: a leaf future may hand `cx.waker()` to
//! another thread and wake it from there, entirely in safe code (channels,
//! timer crates, and `futures` combinators all do this). The waker payload must
//! therefore be thread-safe, even though the [`FutureTask`] it ultimately
//! reschedules is `!Send` and pinned to its owning runtime thread.
//!
//! A waker cannot hold the `Rc<FutureTask>` directly — cloning or dropping that
//! `Rc` from another thread would race its non-atomic refcount (UB), and waking
//! it could schedule the `!Send` future onto the wrong thread. Instead the waker
//! holds only a [`ThreadHandle`] (which is `Send + Sync`) and a numeric task
//! [`id`](TaskWaker::id). Waking looks the task up in the owner thread's
//! registry ([`ThreadState::tasks`](super::state::ThreadState)): a same-thread
//! wake schedules it directly as a microtask, a cross-thread wake routes through
//! the owner's macrotask queue and is resolved on the owner thread. A wake that
//! arrives after the task has completed finds no registry entry and is a no-op.
